Pressure And Video Analysis - August 2022


WARNING - This program is currently being created and is not anywhere near its final state. View/use at your own risk.

This program takes multiple sensory inputs from a series of behavior experiments and creates output figures that try to make sense of the data.

INPUTS
-Video of the behavior in question
-Pressure traces from multiple piezoelectric pressure sensors that are time corelated with the video
-A GoogleSheet spreadsheet that contains experiment notes
-A calibration video with a ruler
-A photo of the study worm with a ruler for size comparisons

OUTPUTS
-%TODO Plots of pressure traces with annotations of behaviors observed
-Images of burrow formation over time shown as heatmaps
-%TODO length of burrow formed over time and graph of burrowing speed
=%TODO size of worm that burrowed in each experiment

-MORE ANALYSES FORTHCOMING AS WE LEARN WHAT WE NEED FROM THE DATA...
